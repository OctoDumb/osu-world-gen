## How to use

1. [Download](https://github.com/OctoDumb/osu-world-gen/releases/latest) and unzip into an empty folder

2. Run `backend.exe` and open http://localhost:7890

3. Click `Add` and add as many IDs as you want

4. When you're done, click `Fetch all` - all regions are cached locally, so you don't have to re-download them every time

## How to get IDs

1. Go to [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html)

2. Find a region, open its details and copy the ID (it should start with `R`)
